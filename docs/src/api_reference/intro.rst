API reference
=============

This API reference documentation is automatically generated leveraging the
`Autodoc <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.htm>`_ Sphinx extension.

It reads the documentation from the `mitsuba` Python module, therefore signatures and types follow
the Python API. As those bindings try to mimic the C++ API as closely as possible, this API
documentation is still relevant and informative with regards to the C++ codebase.

.. warning:: Only the ``scalar_rgb`` variant of the API is documented here, which cover most of the
             framework.
