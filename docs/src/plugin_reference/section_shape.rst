Shapes
======

This section presents an overview of the shape plugins that are released along with the renderer.
In Mitsuba 2, shapes define surfaces that mark transitions between different types of materials. For
instance, a shape could describe a boundary between air and a solid object, such as a piece of rock.
Alternatively, a shape can mark the beginning of a region of space that isnâ€™t solid at all, but
rather contains a participating medium, such as smoke or steam. Finally, a shape can be used to
create an object that emits light on its own.
