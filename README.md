Mitsuba 2 is a research-oriented rendering system written in portable C++17.
It consists of a small set of core libraries and a wide variety of plugins that
implement functionality ranging from materials and light sources to complete
rendering algorithms.

## Compiling

Compiling from scratch requires CMake and a recent version of XCode on Mac,
Visual Studio 2017 on Windows, or GCC/Clang (Clang is preferred) on Linux.

On Linux and MacOS, compiling should be as simple as

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mitsuba-renderer/mitsuba2
cd mitsuba2

# Build using CMake & GNU Make (legacy)
cmake .
make -j 4

# OR: Build using CMake & Ninja (recommended, must install Ninja first)
cmake -GNinja .
ninja
```

On Windows, open the generated ``mitsuba.sln`` file after running
``cmake .`` and proceed building as usual from within Visual Studio.

## Running Mitsuba

Once Mitsuba is compiled, run the ``setpath.sh/bat`` script to configure
environment variables (``PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH/PYTHONPATH``) that are
required to run Mitsuba.

```bash
# On Linux / Mac OS
$ source setpath.sh

# On Windows
C:\...\mitsuba2> setpath
```

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, simply invoke ``pytest``:

```bash
$ pytest
```

The build system also exposes a ``pytest`` target that executes ``setpath`` and
parallelizes the test execution.

```bash
# if using Makefiles
$ make pytest

# if using ninja
$ ninja pytest
```

## Staying up-to-date

Mitsuba organizes its software dependencies in a hierarchy of sub-repositories
using *git submodule*. Unfortunately, as of 2018, pulling from the main
repository won't automatically keep the sub-repositories in sync, which can
lead to various problems. The following command installs a git alias named
``pullall`` that automates these two steps.

```bash
git config --global alias.pullall '!f(){ git pull "$@" && git submodule update --init --recursive; }; f'
```

Afterwards, simply write
```bash
git pullall
```
to stay in sync.
