/** \brief An AnnotatedStream adds a table of contents to an underlying stream
 * that can later be used to selectively read specific items.
 *
 * A Stream instance must first be created and passed to to the constructor.
 * The underlying stream should either be empty or a stream that was previously
 * written with an AnnotatedStream, so that it contains a valid Table of
 * Contents.
 *
 * Table of Contents: objects and variables written to the stream are
 * prepended by a field name. Contents can then be queried by field name, as
 * if using a map.
 * A hierarchy can be created by <tt>push</tt>ing and <tt>pop</tt>ing prefixes.
 * The root of this hierarchy is the empty prefix "".
 *
 * The table of contents is automatically read from the underlying stream on
 * creation and written back on destruction.
