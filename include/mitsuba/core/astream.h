 * underlying stream. A Stream instance must first be created and passed to

 * stream that was previously written with an AnnotatedStream, so that it
 * contains a proper Table of Contents.
 *
 * Table of Contents: objects and variables written to the stream are
 * prepended by a field name. Contents can then be queried by field name, as
 * if using a map.
 * A hierarchy can be created by <tt>push</tt>ing and <tt>pop</tt>ing prefixes.
 * The root of this hierarchy is the empty prefix "".
 *
 * The table of contents is automatically read from the underlying stream on
 * creation and written back on destruction.
